# MindWars

This is a game based on Mastermind. You can specify the number of holes and up to 8 colors. You can play solo, against a friend (no longer works as the server has been neglected and shut down) or against the computer (features a highly optimized and computationally efficient computer-controlled opponent that beats Donald Knuth's algorithm). The game is controlled with your keyboard. The user interface was rushed and easily breaks. (PS: The game is pretty buggy; it was written in haste.)
